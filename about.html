                                    Set up by Claire Wicher in early 2015, CodeUp is the adult version of Code Club. Initially running out of borrowed office
                                    space in central Manchester, the aim was to provide free and friendly adult coding tuition
                                    to anyone who wanted it. Since then it has grown and evolved into a network of spaces
                                    from Preston to Stoke-on-Trent, Chester to Leeds, where complete beginners and accomplished
                                    software engineers (and everyone in between) can come together and share their enjoyment
                                    of coding.

                                    Three years on, the Leeds branch is now open as of February 2018 and a varied amount of people attend each month,
                                    <!--some of whom have gone from
                          beginner to professional developer in that time. -->we also have a team of dedicated mentors who attend almost every month, all of whom specialize
                                    in several languages and technologies.

                                    CodeUp has always relied on generous companies donating their office space, and starting in July 2018, Code Up Leeds will be hosted
                                    at Infinity Works offices. Click <a href="directions.html">here</a> for instructions on how to get there.

                                  <p>
                                    Definitely! You can RSVP on
                                    <a href="https://www.meetup.com/CodeUp-Leeds/" target="_blank">Meetup</a>, but there's no need to do anything specific as a mentor. At the start of the event there is
                                    often a quick matching up of people who are looking for help with a particular language, or you can just
                                    wander round and see who needs a hand.
                                  </p>
                                  <p>
                                    If you've been a few times and feel like you're becoming part of the furniture, you can submit a picture of yourself and
                                    a bit of blurb to Nathan to go on the
                                    <a href="people.html" target="_blank">people</a> page. However, if you're super-duper keen to score bonus respect and kudos, branch off from
                                    master on the CodeUpLeeds repository with the same name as this domain, add yourself to the people
                                    page and put in a pull request. ;)
